This theme is a backport of the Drupal 7 admin theme (designed by Mark and Leisa) with some customizations.

There are quite a few areas that could be improved. Please send pull requests if you have made any changes 
that should be incorporated.

Incomplete list of customizations:
* Added custom (blank) stylesheet
* Added custom (blank) JS file
* Added hover state for table rows
* Added function to add unique classes per field to multigroup node forms
* Added function to generate additional body classes for logged in users (role, uid, etc)
